    "infoPreamble": "Give your domain name a complete checkup! Zonemaster helps you assess how your domain name is doing.",
    "infoTextParagraph1": "When a domain name is sent to Zonemaster for testing, Zonemaster investigates the state of the domain name from the top to the bottom of the DNS tree. This is usually done by examining DNS data from the root, '.', to the Top-Level Domain (TLD) for that domain name, like '.net', and then finally through the DNS servers that contain authoritative information about the specified domain name.",
    "infoTextStrong": "Zonemaster performs many tests,",
    "infoTextParagraph2": "such as checking DNSSEC signatures, or that different hosts can be accessed and that IP addresses are valid. This is all to make sure that your domain name runs as smoothly as possible.",
    "infoHeading2": "A word about the DNS",
    "infoTextParagraph3": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is a database that associates domain names to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, the same way a phone book associates names to phone numbers. An IP address is a unique series of numbers that identifies every computer that is connected to the Internet. It is similar to the way every telephone has its own number in the telephone network. Such long series of numbers work fine for computers, but for people it is way more difficult to memorize. Thus, the DNS has been developed as an extra layer to map between names that we can remember better and IP addresses used by computers whenever we want to reach a specific website or use other services on the Internet, like e-mail.",
