    "ABOUT_DNS_TEXT": "Most people who use the internet have never reflected over what actually happens when one types an address in their web browser and then clicks the enter button. To simplify, the domain name system, (DNS) is a database that associates domain names to IP addresses, the same way a phone book associates names to phone numbers. An IP address is a unique series of numbers that identifies every computer that is connected to the internet. It’s similar to the way every telephone has its own number in the telephone network. A long series of numbers works fine for computers, but it’s difficult for people to memorize. Therefore, DNS has been developed an extra system for us when we want to reach a web server on a specific site or an email server we want to send an email to. ",
    "ABOUT_ZONEMASTER_TEXT": "Give your domain a complete physical! Zonemaster helps you to control how your website is doing. As a bonus, you also get a better understanding of how the domain name system, DNS, works. When a domain (also called zone) is sent to Zonemaster, the program investigates the state of the domain from beginning to end. This is done through Zonemaster examining DNS from the root (.) to the TLD (top-level domain, for example, .se), and then finally through the DNS servers that contain information about the specified domain (for example, zonemaster.se). Zonemaster is also able to perform many other tests, for example, checking the DNSSEC signatures, that different hosts can be accessed and that the IP addresses are valid. This is all to make sure that your domain runs as good as possible",
