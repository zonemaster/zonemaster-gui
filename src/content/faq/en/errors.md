It depends on which test failed for your domain name. Each test is accompanied with one or several messages describing the issues found.

You can also get further insight about each test from the [Test Case Specification documents]( https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster/tree/master/docs/public/specifications/tests#zonemaster-test-case-specifications).
