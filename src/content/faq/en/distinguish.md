question: How can Zonemaster distinguish between what is right and wrong?
category: General information
---

The judgement of Zonemaster is primarily based on the DNS standards as defined in RFCs. It also bases its judgement on DNS best practices, which can be more loosely defined.

All Zonemaster tests are defined in the [Test Case Specification documents](https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster/tree/master/docs/public/specifications/tests#zonemaster-test-case-specifications) in which the references to the standard documents for each test case are found.

The descriptions of message levels such as NOTICE, WARNING and ERROR are found in [Severity Level Definitions](https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster/blob/master/docs/public/specifications/tests/SeverityLevelDefinitions.md).

Sometimes there are different interpretations of the standards or opinions on what is best practice, and the Zonemaster team is always open to input. If you think we have made a mistake in our judgement please do not hesitate to send us an email at [zonemaster-users@lists.iis.se](mailto:zonemaster-users@lists.iis.se) (moderated mailing list) with a link to your test result and an explanation as to why you think it shows something that you consider incorrect.
