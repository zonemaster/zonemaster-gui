question: How come my domain name cannot be tested?
category: Using Zonemaster
---

There are several possibilities.

* Your domain name is not yet delegated.
* Your domain name is not reachable from public Internet.
* Zonemaster can only test what is called a DNS zone, for example 'zonemaster.net', and not host names, like 'www.zonemaster.net'.
* There is a 10 minutes protection between consecutive tests for a given domain name, with same test parameters. Running a test within that window will instead show the last available test for that domain name, and parameters.
* You have misspelled your domain name.
