Info
: The message is something that may be of interest to the zone's administrator but that definitely does not indicate a problem.

Notice

: The message means something that should be known by the zone's administrator but that need not necessarily be a problem at all.

Warning
: The message means something that will under some circumstances be a problem, but that is unlikely to be noticed by a casual user.

Error
: The message means a problem that is very likely (or possibly certain) to negatively affect the function of the zone being tested, but not so severe that the entire zone becomes unresolvable.

Critical
: The message means a very serious error.
