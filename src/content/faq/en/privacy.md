Nothing besides the test domain, other test parameters and the result is stored in the database. Specifically we do not store any information that could link a test to the user who initiated it.

However, since [zonemaster.net](https://zonemaster.net), like other public instances, is open to everyone, it is possible for anyone to test your domain and view its history of tests
