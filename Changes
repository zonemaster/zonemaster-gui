Release history for Zonemaster component Zonemaster-GUI 

v2.0.0 2018-06-25

  * This is the first release version of this code.
  * Old Zonemaster-GUI has been replaced by a entirely new code with
    new architecture.
  * New Zonemaster-GUI is in Javascript only with no Perl, and it talks 
    directly with the Zonemaster-Backend API, in the default installation
    through a web server proxy, e.g. Apache http server.
  * The old Zonemaster-GUI is deprecated, and can, for the time being, 
    still be found in the old repository, 
    https://github.com/dotse/zonemaster-gui
