# Message banner / Release note banner

The application has support for a message banner. This banner can be displayed at the top of the application and is useful for informing users about new features, updates, or important announcements.

It is located in `static/config.json` and the default configuration is empty. The json file contains one single string for each language and whatever you enter as values will show up on the site in the banner.
